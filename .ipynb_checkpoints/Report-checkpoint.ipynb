    "    <p>In recent years, transformers have emerged as a revolutionary architecture in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and beyond. Originally introduced by Vaswani et al. in the paper <strong>\"Attention Is All You Need\"</strong> in 2017, transformers have since become a cornerstone in various machine learning applications due to their exceptional ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information.</p> \n",
    "    <p>At the core of transformer models lies the self-attention mechanism, which enables them to weigh the importance of different words or tokens in a sequence when making predictions or generating output. This mechanism allows transformers to process input data in parallel, making them highly efficient for tasks involving sequential data, such as language translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis.</p> \n",
    "    <p>In the realm of trading, transformers have garnered considerable attention for their potential to analyze vast amounts of financial data and extract meaningful patterns and insights. By leveraging the inherent capabilities of transformers to capture temporal dependencies and complex relationships within financial time series data, researchers and practitioners aim to develop more accurate and robust trading models.</p> \n",
    "    <p>In this report, we explore the application of transformer-based models in trading using <strong>5-minute AAPL (Apple Inc.)</strong> data. We will examine their effectiveness in capturing market dynamics, making predictions, and informing trading strategies. Through a combination of theoretical insights and practical examples, we aim to shed light on the role of transformers in reshaping the landscape of algorithmic trading and quantitative finance.</p> \n",

Through data preparation, technical indicator application, model configuration, and rigorous evaluation, we have endeavored to develop algorithms capable of capturing market dynamics and informing trading decisions. In the following sections, we summarize our findings, discuss key insights, and propose avenues for future research and refinement.</p>\n",

    "    <p>Our methodology consisted of a systematic approach to develop and evaluate trading models using transformer-based architectures. The process involved the following steps:</p>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>Data Preparation: We collected historical trading data for the AAPL stock at 5-minute intervals. The data was preprocessed to handle missing values and standardized to ensure uniformity across features.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Technical Indicator Application: We applied a variety of technical indicators, including Relative Strength Index (RSI), Weighted Moving Average (WMA), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Bollinger Bands, to derive additional features from the raw price data.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Model Configuration: We configured transformer models to accept input features derived from the technical indicators. Hyperparameters such as the number of layers, attention heads, and hidden dimensions were optimized through a grid search process.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Training and Validation: The models were trained on the preprocessed data using a portion of the dataset, while another portion was reserved for validation to assess model performance.</li>\n",
    "    </ol>\n",
